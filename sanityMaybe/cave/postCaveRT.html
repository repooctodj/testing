 <!--cave bear from behind what is it : img...pivot: text so dont have to keep drawing bears for this.. -->
 <p>
  You come back to a table still set for tea.
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank"> The Ursus Arctos </a>
  Is sitting at the table knitting. When
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank"> The Ursus </a>
  looks up, hearing your steps cruch agains the cave floor, you hear that soothing voice again. 
 </p>
 <p>
  Oh dear, Im so glad you are back with the milk and sugar.
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank"> The Ursus Arctos </a>
  gathers the items from you and turns to go. Suddenly
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank"> The Ursus Arctos </a>
  stops, and it turns back around. My frend should be here for tea, such a wonderful 
  conversationalist. While I prepare would you <a href="caveSuccessBox.html">be a dear and get them</a> for 
  me? You hear the voice say. They hang out around the river at the bottom of the caves.
