 <!--cave bear from behind what is it : img...pivot: text so dont have to keep drawing bears for this.. -->
 <p>
  You come back to a table still set for tea.
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank"> The Ursus Arctos </a>
  Is sitting at the table with the tiger. The tiger is chatting and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank"> The Ursus Arctos </a> is giggling.
 </p>
 <p>
  Oh dear, Im so glad you are back, the soothing voice says. Come sit down. Tiger is such a wonderful conversationalist. Have some tea. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank"> The Ursus Arctos </a> pours you a cup while tiger adds sugar and milk. As you sip your tea you reflect on your adventure to tea time with warm and fuzzy feelings. Then you start to nod off. </p>
