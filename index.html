<p id="question" >I initially started writing this in order to create a templet for my pi club on how they could use childrens books to help them come up with a storyline to create a  room based HTML game. I started it before Covid hit, like 2019 and didn't finish until 2022 I was planning on creating a map based game to go along with this story, but for now just the finishing of the rewriting process is good enough for me. <br><a href="dinosDragonsNtacos/dinosDragonsAndTacos/novellaPages/CH1-Introductions.html" target="_blank">9.2.22</a> </p>
<p>Now I want more, an interactive installation with a web element like a digital turn by turn map walking tour with cardboard props....but where to start? <br>1.30.23<p/>

<p id="question" >I started this experience to just walk people around my branch of the county library system. Then it evolved, then I casted my coworkers, then I let Jake playtest it. He was super excited about it. Then It grew, and now I have no idea whats going on and its in constant progress. Today if you play you may get a different game than next week. One day Jake will get to play the "complete" edition, or maybe constant fluxis its final form. Only time will tell. In the mean time, enjoy. <br>2.7.23</p>

<div class="grid-item"><p>For 'Misty Eyed' Mike</p>
<p id="question" >I decided to get a few tattoos after I got into a car wreck. I figured the next time I lost my bearings due to my brain moving and groving around too much in my skull, it would be best to have a reference nearby to help me regain my center and remember who I was and what I was about. I met Mike randomly one day when he posted that he was available to do some random flash one day and for whatever reason I was like I'm free and I just got paied. Mike has great energy and always seems excited and down to tattoo, and that carried into this tattoo. This Space Pirate Bunny may seem cuddly but this story is as layered as my life. I'm still figuring out how to make autobiographical 'fiction' work for me, but best to start than to keep thinking about starting. I know however this turns out Mike will be psyched to see it, and that makes it worth it. *insert heart hands emoji here*. <br>2.7.23</p>
