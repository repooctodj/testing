He is now best remembered for his science fiction novels and is often called the "father of science fiction" along with jules verne and hugo gernsback. During his own lifetime, however, he was most prominent as a forward-looking, even prophetic social critic who devoted his literary talents to the development of a progressive vision on a global scale. A futurist, he wrote a number of utopian works and foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television and something resembling the World Wide Web. His science fiction imagined time travel, alien invasion, invisibility, and biological engineering. Brian Aldiss referred to Wells as the "Shakespeare of science fiction". Wells rendered his works convincing by instilling commonplace detail alongside a single extraordinary assumption – dubbed “Wells’s law” – leading Joseph Conrad to hail him in 1898 as "O Realist of the Fantastic!". His most notable science fiction works include The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), The War of the Worlds (1898) and the military science fiction The War in the Air (1907). } -->

As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.Ada Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and Lady Byron.[5] All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women.[6] Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever. Four months later, he commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, "Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?"[7] He died in Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace. -->

When you look at one of his paintings, its like looking at everything in a truer way you never thought of, a kind of off-kilter dream world. It's not always pleasant, or even comfortable, but that's the point. The truth isn't always nice. After that, I decided to open a gallery when I graduated. I wanted to find other artist who could make me feel that way, because there had to be some, didn't there? Not everything was pictures of flowers and fruit." She gave a defeated shrug. "Turns out, I was wrong. That's just what everything is." <br><br>
"Except for your friend in the Annex."<br><br>
"Exactly." She raised her glass in a little toast. "Except for him.""</p>

<p>"in that moment in the darkness. The anger and bitterness that drove his uncle to build this house, that drove him to steal his brothers children from a place where they were happy seeped into him. He understood why Elenor was so cruel to him why their uncle was so callous to both of them. He understood the appeal of spite. Being mean because it was all you had. That emotion and revelation poured from every board and nail of the house and washed thru him. It made him feel sick, fightend, and empowered all at once. He felt like he might wet his pants, but also, like he might have the ability to fly. Or make himself grow big enough to be a giant who was big enough to make others feel small and weak instead of always being the one who felt like that. "</p>

<p>"So, at last, a confession. I was the one who did it. <br> Not the Nursery; that was Elise. But the rest of it. The Annex. The drones and watchmen. The splendid houses and grand edifices and endless, temperate days for the privileged few to pass in gentle ease while the unacknowledged masses labored in the shadows of their masters' pleasure. The dream of Prospera may have been Elise's; the design was mine from the start. <br> Why did I do it? What thought possessed me that I should make one person's happy dream another's ceaseless nightmare? Better to ask: Who, having slumbered centuries in paradise, would willingly awaken to build a life from nothing, to hew it from the rock and ice of an alien world? To the colonist I say: I gave you what you needed, which was a weight to push against. A life you would be glad to leave, and a life to make you ready. <br> Do you hate me for this? Surely I have earned your loathing. I will not ask you for forgiveness. For such a crime as mine, there can be no pardon, save for God's alone. <br> And to you, the sleepers in my keeping: you have lived for countless lifetimes; you shall live for coutless more. They will be different from the ones you've always known; your days of idlenees and ease are gone. This is not a punishment--far from it. It is my gift to you, that you should be redeemed. I will give you childhood, so that you might know innocence. Age, so you will know the prize of youth. Children so that youw ill care for the future. Toil, so that you will know the value of a day. The body's failings, so that you will know its worth. Death, so that you will cheris the bittersweet beauty of life. We are, each of us born a sparkling soul, clothed onlyi n our newness; it is life that makes us what we are. You have been one thing; now you will learn to be another. And so we voyage out once more. What will we find at our final port of call? What

of mankind yet remain upon the plate? Shall we discover only the wind-scraped remains of a ruined world, none but ourselves for company? Not all of us will live to see that day. Time's nibbling jaws can be slowed; they cannot be stopped. Circuits will fail. Mechanisms will falter. Others among you will die in your cabinets of time itself--that is to say, of age. A freind, sitting across a table, will look up to find a vacant chair where you had sat. A spouse will turn to you in bed and discover only empty space, the sheets still warm with the heat of your vanished body. A shock, yet your absence will be met with perplexity above all else, the dreamscape quickly subsuming your memory, like waves over a drowned man. Whatever happend to...? Has anybody seen...? Wasn't she right here...? They will shake their heads in puzzlemnet and then, with only the vaguest feeling of disturbance, go on about their business. How strange, how very strange.. <br> We are indeed such stuff as dreams are made on, our little life rounded with a sleep.<br><br> Thus I beam this tale into the cosmos: this message ina  bottle, tossed into the heaven's waves. Perhaps there is no one to receive it. Perhaps there is but one mind left to listen: the mind behind all things, like a face beneath the painter's canvas. Whoever you are, in whatever form you take--time, matter, light--I ask one thing only: that you leave us as we are. Let us sleep, and dream, and do the work of being human."</p>

<p>"When this story gets under way, everyone knows that this slave old man willsoon die. This conviction is based on no evidence at all. He is still vigorous and seems like an indestructible mineral, something <em>djok-strong</em>. His eyes are neither shining nor dull but dense, like certain backwaters struck by lightning. His speech keeps itself more elusive than echoes off a surfside cliff (and as inaccessible of meaning). He subjects his cabin to the maniacal housecleaning of the elderly, and his survival garden, scraped out beneath the trees, is a fine example of a fight against famine. So nothing. Nothing suggest that his end is near except his incalculable age, which even the ancientest ledgers of the Plantation could not guarantee. The most wizened elders cannot remember the day of his birth, and no one still alive tasted the feast at his baptism. Therefore, all are obscurely aware that his quarter hour upon this earth (that brief allotted span) has unraveled its last bit. " </p>

<p>"Since the arrival of the colonist, this island has become a magma of earth fire water and winds stirred up by the hunger for spices. Many souls have melted away there. The Amerindians of the first times turned themselves into wirithing vines of suffering that strangle the trees and stream over the cliffs, like the unappeased blood of their own genocide. The slave ships of the second times have brought in black Africans fated to bondage in the cane fields. Only it wasn't people the slavers began selling to the <em>beke</em> planters, but slow processions of undone flesh slathered with oil and vinegar. These creatures seemed not to emerge from the abyss, but to belong to it forevermore. The colonist alone manipulate the carnal masses of this heaving magma (baptizing, murdering, liberating, building, growing rich), but the planters seem more like fermenting matter than like living people, and their eyes, dictating the actions of slavery, undoubtedly no longer blink in any way validated by innocence, decency, pity. A fig for those miseries so often illustrated, let's put a name to this horror: the <em>grandios in-humanity</em> that exploits human beings as an inert, indescribable density."</p>

His genealogy, his probable lineage of papa mama great-grandparents, is limited to the navel sunk in his belly, which <em>zieute-</em>eyeballs the world like an empty coconut hole, quite cold adn with no age-old dreams. The slave old man is depthless like his navel."</p>
