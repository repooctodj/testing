<!-- {English writer. Prolific in many genres, writing dozens of novels, short stories, an works of social commentary,history, satire, biography, and autobiography, and even two books on recreational war games. He is now best remembered for his science fiction novels and is often called the "father of science fiction" along with jules verne and hugo gernsback. During his own lifetime, however, he was most prominent as a forward-looking, even prophetic social critic who devoted his literary talents to the development of a progressive vision on a global scale. A futurist, he wrote a number of utopian works and foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television and something resembling the World Wide Web. His science fiction imagined time travel, alien invasion, invisibility, and biological engineering. Brian Aldiss referred to Wells as the "Shakespeare of science fiction". Wells rendered his works convincing by instilling commonplace detail alongside a single extraordinary assumption – dubbed “Wells’s law” – leading Joseph Conrad to hail him in 1898 as "O Realist of the Fantastic!". His most notable science fiction works include The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), The War of the Worlds (1898) and the military science fiction The War in the Air (1907). } -->

Objectivisms main tenets are that reality exists independently of consciousness, that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception (see direct and indirect realism) that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive logic, that the proper moral purpose of ones life is the pursuit of ones on happiness (see rational egoism), that the only social system consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-faire capitalism, and that the role of art in human life is to transform humans' metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of rreality into a physical form, a work of art, that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally. } -->

As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.Ada Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and Lady Byron.[5] All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women.[6] Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever. Four months later, he commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, "Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?"[7] He died in Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace. -->

"Spanish painter, twenieth century. He invented somethiing called Cubism. It's hard to deescribe, you'd really have to see it, but basically, he took all three dimensions of an image and showed them at the same time so you could see it from differnt angles simultaneously. When you look at one of his paintings, its like looking at everything in a truer way you never thought of, a kind of off-kilter dream world. It's not always pleasant, or even comfortable, but that's the point. The truth isn't always nice. After that, I decided to open a gallery when I graduated. I wanted to find other artist who could make me feel that way, because there had to be some, didn't there? Not everything was pictures of flowers and fruit." She gave a defeated shrug. "Turns out, I was wrong. That's just what everything is." <br><br>
"Except for your friend in the Annex."<br><br>
"Exactly." She raised her glass in a little toast. "Except for him.""</p>

<p>"in that moment in the darkness. The anger and bitterness that drove his uncle to build this house, that drove him to steal his brothers children from a place where they were happy seeped into him. He understood why Elenor was so cruel to him why their uncle was so callous to both of them. He understood the appeal of spite. Being mean because it was all you had. That emotion and revelation poured from every board and nail of the house and washed thru him. It made him feel sick, fightend, and empowered all at once. He felt like he might wet his pants, but also, like he might have the ability to fly. Or make himself grow big enough to be a giant who was big enough to make others feel small and weak instead of always being the one who felt like that. "</p>

The dream of Prospera may have been Elise's; the design was mine from the start. <br> Why did I do it? What thought possessed me that I should make one person's happy dream another's ceaseless nightmare? Better to ask: Who, having slumbered centuries in paradise, would willingly awaken to build a life from nothing, to hew it from the rock and ice of an alien world? To the colonist I say: I gave you what you needed, which was a weight to push against. A life you would be glad to leave, and a life to make you ready. <br> Do you hate me for this?

They will be different from the ones you've always known; your days of idlenees and ease are gone. This is not a punishment--far from it. It is my gift to you, that you should be redeemed. I will give you childhood, so that you might know innocence. Age, so you will know the prize of youth. Children so that youw ill care for the future. Toil, so that you will know the value of a day. The body's failings, so that you will know its worth. Death, so that you will cheris the bittersweet beauty of life. We are, each of us born a sparkling soul, clothed onlyi n our newness; it is life that makes us what we are. You have been one thing; now you will learn to be another. And so we voyage out once more.

Time's nibbling jaws can be slowed; they cannot be stopped. Circuits will fail. Mechanisms will falter. Others among you will die in your cabinets of time itself--that is to say, of age. A freind, sitting across a table, will look up to find a vacant chair where you had sat. A spouse will turn to you in bed and discover only empty space, the sheets still warm with the heat of your vanished body. A shock, yet your absence will be met with perplexity above all else, the dreamscape quickly subsuming your memory, like waves over a drowned man. Whatever happend to...? Has anybody seen...? Wasn't she right here...? They will shake their heads in puzzlemnet and then, with only the vaguest feeling of disturbance, go on about their business. How strange, how very strange.. <br> We are indeed such stuff as dreams are made on, our little life rounded with a sleep.<br><br> Thus I beam this tale into the cosmos: this message ina  bottle, tossed into the heaven's waves. Perhaps there is no one to receive it. Perhaps there is but one mind left to listen: the mind behind all things, like a face beneath the painter's canvas.

<p>"When this story gets under way, everyone knows that this slave old man willsoon die. This conviction is based on no evidence at all. He is still vigorous and seems like an indestructible mineral, something <em>djok-strong</em>. His eyes are neither shining nor dull but dense, like certain backwaters struck by lightning. His speech keeps itself more elusive than echoes off a surfside cliff (and as inaccessible of meaning). He subjects his cabin to the maniacal housecleaning of the elderly, and his survival garden, scraped out beneath the trees, is a fine example of a fight against famine. So nothing. Nothing suggest that his end is near except his incalculable age, which even the ancientest ledgers of the Plantation could not guarantee. The most wizened elders cannot remember the day of his birth, and no one still alive tasted the feast at his baptism. Therefore, all are obscurely aware that his quarter hour upon this earth (that brief allotted span) has unraveled its last bit. " </p>

<p>"Since the arrival of the colonist, this island has become a magma of earth fire water and winds stirred up by the hunger for spices. Many souls have melted away there. The Amerindians of the first times turned themselves into wirithing vines of suffering that strangle the trees and stream over the cliffs, like the unappeased blood of their own genocide. The slave ships of the second times have brought in black Africans fated to bondage in the cane fields. Only it wasn't people the slavers began selling to the <em>beke</em> planters, but slow processions of undone flesh slathered with oil and vinegar. These creatures seemed not to emerge from the abyss, but to belong to it forevermore. The colonist alone manipulate the carnal masses of this heaving magma (baptizing, murdering, liberating, building, growing rich), but the planters seem more like fermenting matter than like living people, and their eyes, dictating the actions of slavery, undoubtedly no longer blink in any way validated by innocence, decency, pity. A fig for those miseries so often illustrated, let's put a name to this horror: the <em>grandios in-humanity</em> that exploits human beings as an inert, indescribable density."</p>

<p>"The Master, questioning him, has indeed tried to make him into a voice of wisdom. Has even called him Papa as his father did, and his grandfather, and like his eldest son, who now does it too. But the antique slave wheedles no advantage from this, departs not a whit from correct servile behavior. Remains unalterable. . . Even the slaves attempted to amke a Papa out of him. A conveyor of Promised Land. An old-timey fount of wisdom and history. A guide, like the stake of manioc wood planted to pilot new shoots. A <em>Mentor.</em> Often they questioned him about the Before-land, the meaning and direction of the pathway ahead, the need to kill the Master, his offspring, his Lady, and burn the Great House. Rebels have sought his blessing right before their flight through the woods and their tracking by the deadly mastiff. But he never said anything or gave anything or offered the slightest hand to such magical expectations. His silence stirs up their fire: folks attribute powers and forces to him. The treat him as a <em>knower,</em> able to best teh venom of the <em>Betes-longues</em> and wrest from plants the contradictory qualities of the remedy-for-all-ills and the perfect poison. He can, they swear, purge maladies, strip away the sorrows of life, postpone the grip of death itself, whose crony he seems to be. Hemmed in by their entreaties, he places palms on mortal pains, or puts his lips to the knotted forehead of a dying man, or holds the stiffened claws of a sufferer heading off in agony to the Before-land....But he never does more. Even if certain miracles occur, eevn if he confers by chance through these gestrues some strength...his eyes still won't light up, or his skin give a shiver. Definitive, he takes on the opaque substance of that mass of men who are no longer men, who are not beasts, who are not, either, like that oceanic maw all around the country. They are a confusion of ravaged bings, indistinct in something formless. Everybody winds up hating him. Then venerating him. Then hating him again. Then forgetting him. Then wondering how old his is. Then treating him the way one treats wreches from whom no one longer expects anything. With a somewhat puzzled respect, a neutral and slightly indifferent kindness. Thanks to this treatment, he, too, surely persuades himself that he has worn out his time. And although he gets used to this idea, it doesn't change his behavior one bit. "</p>

<p>"The mastiff was a monster. It as well had voyaged on a ship for weeks in a kind of horror. It as well had experienced that void of a voyage via slave ship. The black flesh, crammed into the hold, enveloped that sail-winged hell with a halo the monster's rage perceived and the sharks pursued across the ocean. As had all those who came in to the islands, the mastiff had endured the constant rolling of the sea, its unfathomable echoes, its engulfment of time, its irreparable dismantaling of intimante spaces, the slow drifting away of the memories it engendered. A sea that penetrated flesh to harry and thwart its soul, or decompose it, replacing it with the petty rhythm of nauseating survivals, small deaths, bitter routines, the martyrdom of carcasses taht must cope with disorienting uncertainties. The mastiff had known periods in the open air as well. . . the dog was forced like the black captives to go around in circles so as to limber up its muscles and inhale a bit of iodine on the high seas. And the wind itself, dazzling as an onrush of darkness, would put the finishing touches on the devastation committed by the dea in the depths of those nights in the 'tween decks. The dog would stagger along, limp like a jellyfish. Then be sent back into the dead angle of a stern gangway, that tomb (its cage): the after-hold. The dog's gaze resembled that of the sailors. And worse: the wraiths who rose from the hold (weighed down less by their chains than by their shattered souls, and who sometimes threw themselves overboard into the sharks' jaws or suddenly, arching their bodies, swallowed their tonges, or even fell in wasted rage against the bayonet protecting a captain's throat) had that same gaze. Only the ship itself, through its rhythm of waves, the snapping magesty of its tall sails, seemed to live and to keep those captives alive. The mastiff was a monster because it had known that absolute collapse."  </p>
